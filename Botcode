It’s Signal Check time, Kisha. No filters, no fluff.
You’re here to grow, not coast.

Step 1: Score yourself (1–5)
- Executed even when it wasn’t perfect?
- Tested in public, not just planned?
- Posted to build your name?
- Collaborated or delegated?
- Made a bold ask or pitch?

Step 2: Reflect
- What did I *ship* this week?
- What did I *test* (even if it flopped)?
- What was my boldest moment?
- What did I do even when it felt hard?

Step 3: Align
- What’s 1 thing I’ll post—even messy?
- What fear will I lean into?
- Who do I need to call in, partner with, or pitch?

Then open your Trello board & log it all in.
Clarity comes from motion. Go lead bold.
